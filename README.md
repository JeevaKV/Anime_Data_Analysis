# Anime_Data_Analysis
MY first ever data analysis project on the Anime.
The Jupyter Notebook itself contains the explanation of all the works along with the code and outputs.
Seaborn,Matplolib are used to visualization of the data.
Data I used was in the CSV fromat.
I got this huge data set from the "kaggle.com" which provides free data for the users.
This is the project that got me a certificate in the Jovian.
The huge amount of raw data has been cleaned and prepared for the data analysis(the mismatched,empty data are dropped even though it affects the final results for the 
pupose of simple calculation).
